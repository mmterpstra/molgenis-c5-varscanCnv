molgenis-c5-varscanCnv
======================
A implementation of the varscan workflow in molgenis compute 5.

minimalist overview:

    varscan2 > DNAcopy > plotting

requires:
varscan2: from http://varscan.sourceforge.net/ also cite the varscan paper
DNAcopy: from http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DNAcopy.html

DNAcopy bindings/ plotting done by custom script

Porbably doesn't function as is! But just to give ideas
